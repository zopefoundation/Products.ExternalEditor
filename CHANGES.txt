Zelenium Product Changelog

  Zelenium-0.5 (2005/05/04)

    - CVS tag:  'Zelenium-0_5'

    - Updated to use the "TestRunner core" from Selenium version 0.3.0.
      See http://selenium.thoughtworks.com/release-notes.html for more
      information.

    - Add unit tests for Zuite class.

    - Make ZIPfile generation work with nested suites.

  Zelenium-0.4.1 (2005/05/02)

    - CVS tag:  'Zelenium-0_4_1'

    - Repair breakage of ExternalEditor link in 'manage_main'.

    - Compensate in display of test tables for non-padded integers
      in the IDs (make them sort properly).

  Zelenium-0.4 (2005/04/27)

    - CVS tag:  'Zelenium-0_4'
 
    - Make Zuite instances recursively include their Zuite children's
      test cases (to allow easier organization of the test cases in a
      hierarchy).

    - Allow indiviual zuites to override the list of metatypes which
      can be test cases, via a new 'testcase_metatypes' property.

    - Force Zuite objects to show order support, even in the presence of
      ExternalEditor, whose monkey patching seems to trip it up.  Surface
      the EE icon, if the product is available

      Note:  we are *forking* OFS/dtml/main.dtml and the version in
      ExteranalEditor/manage_main.dtml to surface order support, which
      is a pretty brutal hack.  We should probably get ExteranalEditor
      fixed, instead, and rip out the forked copy.

    - CVS tag:  'Zelenium-0_3_1'

    - Record server-side data during 'postResults':  Zope version string,

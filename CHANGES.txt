External Editor Change Log

    - Fixed Windows "body_file" bug.

    - Added binary build support for Windows using py2exe and Inno setup.

    - Fixed Windows config file locator. It now looks in the program directory
      and then the user's home directory (if specified)

    - Fixed bug in Windows registry editor lookup.

  6/16/02 - 0.3 Release

    - Improved behavior when saving after lock attempts fail.

    - Now works on Windows (applause) using Pythonwin. Much overall
      refactoring to abstract process control. Thanks to Oliver Deckmyn,
      Gabriel Genellina and Arno Gross for testing, patches and suggestions.

    - Added "temp_dir" configuration option for specifying a different
      temp file directory then the OS default. Also further improved 
      temp file name generation.

    - Added support for domain specific configuration options.

    - Fixed trailing newline bug in encoded auth data coming from
      CookieCrumbler. Thanks to Harald Koschinski.

    - You can now pass command line arguments to the editor in the config file,
      or wrap the editor in an xterm without using a shell script.
      
    - Rewrote "Editor did not launch" error message so it makes more sense.

    - Fixed https detection bug. External editor is now tested and working with
      https. Many thanks to Hans-Dieter Stich and Martin Grönemeyer for their 
      assistance and ideas.

    - Made it possible to edit objects that are methods of ZClasses. Thanks to
      Jim Washington

    - Refactored link generation code in manage_main so that it uses
      the parent's absolute_url rather than URL1. Thanks to
      Jim Washington

    - Removed implicit save in Configuration class destructor

    - Added caching headers to prevent client-side caching of edit data.
      Thanks to Gabriel Genellina for pointing this out.

    - Eliminated spurious "Editor did not launch" errors on short sessions
      or when other errors occurred.

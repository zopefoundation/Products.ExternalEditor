  - (__future__) Exposed role management for manager users on
    the default roster:  managers can now "promote" members
    without going to the ZMI.

  - (__future__) Added "custom schema" mechanism for content
    objetcts:  site managers can now define additional
    propertysheets for a content type, which will then be
    reflected in instances created from the type.

  - (__future__) Added simple link extraction / checking for
    textual content.  Link checking also works for Link objects.

  - (__future__) Added "composite content" types (see the
    "dogbowl proposal",
    (http://cmf.zope.org/rqmts/proposals/compounds/compoundproposal.txt).

  - (__future__) Added DCWorkflow (through-the-web configurable
    workflows) to the core set of CMF products.

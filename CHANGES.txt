  New Features

    - Interfaces: Added newstyle (Zope 3) interfaces.
      This change has no effect on Zope 2.7 without Five.

    - CMFDefault skins: Added members_delete_form.
      This adds a confirmation step to avoid accidental deletion of members.

    - DirectoryView and derived classes can now have metadata associated with
      them just like regular FSObject-derived objects can.

    - DirectoryView and derived classes: It is now possible to customize what 
      gets created to represent directories inside the directory view.
      Previously, the code had a fixed assumption that all directories on the 
      file system must turn into instances of 
      CMFCore.DirectoryView.DirectoryView(Surrogate). It is now possible to 
      register a class deriving from DirectoryView and have that be 
      instantiated instead.

    - ActionsTool: Added new way to define Actions.
      'CMF Action Category' objects can now be added to the portal_actions
      tool and 'CMF Action' objects to categories or subcategories. To
      migrate oldstyle Actions (ActionInformation objects) you can create a
      snapshot and re-import Actions using the portal_setup tool.

    - TypesTool: TypeInformation classes are now pluggable.
      Any class that implements the TypeInformation interface and is
      a registered meta type can now be used in the TypesTool.

  Bug Fixes

    - DublinCore and PortalFolder: Changed fallback in 'Type' method.
      The fallback is only necessary if the related type info is missing.

    - CMFCore.PortalContent: Wrong variable name in __call__ would blow up
      if no default view could be found for a piece of content.

  Others

    - CMFSetup: the import/export of portal types uses a new XML format
      that can hold arbitrary properties, to facilitate subclassing. The
      old format is still recognized when importing.

    - To document how to create a CMF release from CMF a description is now
      included in RELEASE.txt at the root of the CMF package. This text can
      guide release managers or volunteers with the appropriate release
      privileges.

    - Added DeprecationWarning to the all_cmf_tests.py script. The canonical
      way to run the tests is using "zopectl test".
      (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/272)

    - CMFDefault: Oldstyle DefaultWorkflowDefinition is no longer registered.
      So you can't accidentally add this deprecated workflow.

    - The "Access future portal content" was not used anywhere and has been
      removed. (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/240)

    - CMFDefault: Marked 'manage_addCMFSite' as deprecated.
      To add a new CMF site, select 'Configured CMF Site'. The 'CMFDefault
      Site' profile creates a new site like those you know from 'CMF Site'.

    - CMFDefault: Cleaned out some super-ancient code for migrating
      or fixing PTK content so it would work with CMF.

    - CatalogTool: Removed deprecated indexes and metadata.
      'Creator' was replaced by 'listCreators', 'portal_type' should be used
      instead of 'meta_type'.

    - CMFCore: Removed some deprecated aliases and constants.

    - Permissions: Removed deprecated oldstyle permission modules.

    - TypeInformation: Removed deprecated Type method.

    - PortalFolder: Removed deprecated _morphSpec() and spec arguments.

    - Portal Types: Removed deprecated _getViewFor / getActionById machinery.
      PortalContent objects might be used as methods, so __call__() still
      returns their default view.

    - CMFDefault and CMFTopic skins: Removed deprecated DTML skins and layers.

    - ActionsTool: Removed deprecated support for oldstyle Action Providers.
      If Action Providers don't implement the ActionProvider interface they
      are now ignored.

    - Workflow: Removed deprecated WorkflowMethod machinery.

  New Features

    - profiles: Moved 'default' profile to CMFDefault.
      Using the new 'importVarious' handler this profile now allows to create
      CMF sites identical to those created with manage_addCMFSite.

    - CMFDefault: Added 'importVarious' setup handler.
      This provisional handler will be removed again as soon as full handlers
      are implemented for these steps.

  Bug Fixes

    - 

  Others

    - CMFDefault: Cleaned out some super-ancient code for migrating
      or fixing PTK content so it would work with CMF.

    - CatalogTool: Removed deprecated indexes and metadata.
      'Creator' was replaced by 'listCreators', 'portal_type' should be used
      instead of 'meta_type'.

    - CMFCore: Removed some deprecated aliases and constants.

    - Permissions: Removed deprecated oldstyle permission modules.

    - TypeInformation: Removed deprecated Type method.

    - PortalFolder: Removed deprecated _morphSpec() and spec arguments.

    - Portal Types: Removed deprecated _getViewFor / getActionById machinery.
      PortalContent objects might be used as methods, so __call__() still
      returns their default view.

    - CMFDefault and CMFTopic skins: Removed deprecated DTML skins and layers.

    - ActionsTool: Removed deprecated support for oldstyle Action Providers.
      If Action Providers don't implement the ActionProvider interface they
      are now ignored.

    - Workflow: Removed deprecated WorkflowMethod machinery.

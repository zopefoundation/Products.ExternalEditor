Somewhere over the rainbow

  - (__future__) Exposed role management for manager users on
    the default roster:  managers can now "promote" members
    without going to the ZMI.

  - (__future__) Added "custom schema" mechanism for content
    objetcts:  site managers can now define additional
    propertysheets for a content type, which will then be
    reflected in instances created from the type.

  - (__future__) Added simple link extraction / checking for
    textual content.  Link checking also works for Link objects.

  - (__future__) Added "composite content" types (see the
    "dogbowl proposal",
    (http://cmf.zope.org/rqmts/proposals/compounds/compoundproposal.txt).

  - (__future__) Added DCWorkflow (through-the-web configurable
    workflows) to the core set of CMF products.

1.2 beta (2001/12/07)

 New features

  - Added docs from the crack ZC docs guys; these docs live in
    the top-level 'docs' directory.

  - Merged CMFDecor product's artifacts into CMFCore /
    CMFDefault;  theses aretifacts allow use of filesystem-based
    Zope Page Templates as skins.

    Note that the CMFDecor skin is the one which will be
    receiving all our development focus:  we will fix bugs in the
    DTML skins, but are not likely to invest significant effort
    in upgrading it.

  - Hooked 'manage_addFolder' to allow creation of PortalFolders
    from both WebDAV, FTP, and ZMI.

  - Improved tracebacks from broken FSDTMLMethods, which no longer
    indicate that every problem is in RestrictedDTML.

  - Made it possible to add CookieCrumblers in nested folders.
    You can just drop in a cookie crumbler anywhere to change the
    login form for that area of the site.  In fact, now you don't
    have to create a user folder just to change the login
    process.

  - Made Link objects editable via FTP / WebDAV.

  - Merged Chris Withers' FSSQLMethod into CMFCore.

  - Added documentation for installing from CVS.

  - Moved permission checking inside personalize_form to make
    sure Anonymous cannot access it without logging in (CMF Tracker
    Issue 349, thanks go to Bill Anderson).

  - Added initial CMF use cases as FSSTXMethods in CMFDefault/help.

  - Made validation methods of 'portal_metadata' available to
    scripts.

  - Made skinned 'index_html' reflect generic view on folder
    content, rather than simple title/description of the portal.

  - Added "Change and View" submit button to content editing
    forms;  added check for this button to POST handlers in CMFDefault,
    and indirected redirect targets in those methods through
    'getActionByID'.

  - Added knob for skin cookie persistence to SkinsTool's
    "properties" tab.  The default policy (unchanged) is that
    skin cookies expire at the end of the browser session.  if
    Skin Cookie Persistence is checked the cookie will last a
    full yesr.

  - Added an API to the 'portal_actions' interface for querying,
    adding, and removing action providers.

  - Added a "multi-review" form, enabling a reviewer to publish
    or reject multiple items at once, using a common comment.

  - Added ZMI tab to DirectoryView to allow re-basing the
    filesystem path.

  - Added "breadcrumbs" to CMFDecor skins.

  - Added initial support for WebDAV locaking to PortalContent.

  - Added SortCriterion to list of criterion types for Topics,
    to permit sorting of results.

  - Added "Local Roles" action to folders to ease collaboration.

  - Add scarecrow assertions for the CMF-centric interfaces, and
    made the actual interfaces compatible with the standard
    Zope Interface package.

  - Made FSSTXMethod display skinnable, and added ZPT version.

  - Added 'visible' attribute to TypeInformation actions, to
    permit indirection (via 'getActionById') without exposing the
    action in the CMF UI.

  - Extended MetadataTool to allow adding / removing element specs
    (i.e., it can now manage policies for "custom" schemas, as
    well as Dublin Core).

 Bug fixes

  - Refactored content and metadata editing methods of
    DefaultDublinCoreImpl, Document, and NewsItem to disentangle
    the excessive coupling.  Each "path" for editing now has a
    "presentation"-level method, which directs traffic and
    reindexes the object;  the underlying methods are much
    simplified.

  - Fixed inner / named links in Document / News Item (thanks to 
    Kenichi Sato for the patch!)

  - Ensured that editing methods handle WebDAV locks correctly,
    using a new 'failIfLocked' assertion.

  - Added cookString method to CMFCore.utils for taking a string
    and making it id friendly, it also does a string.lower on the
    resultant regex.  Changed TypesTool to utilize cookString to
    ensure that action ids are properly formated if the name is
    being used as the id.

  - Added 'getReply' to CMFDefault.DiscussionItem.DiscussionItemContainer,
    to permit access to an individual reply without needing to
    do traversal.

  - Corrected pass-through of 'file' and 'seatbelt' arguments in
    new 'CMFDefault.Document.edit' method;  also sync'ed ZMI edit
    method for documents with standard protocol (Tracker #417).

  - Added cookString method to CMFCore.utils for taking a string and
    making it id friendly, it also does a string.lower on the resultant
    regex.
    
  - Made examples in INSTALL.txt less terse, and added notes on
    Windows-specific issues (thanks to Johan Mukhsein for the
    suggestions).

  - Made error message generated by FSPropertiesObject capture the
    offending line and line #;  also, added logic to allow blank
    lines and comment lines beginning with '#' (tracker #338).

  - Added fixup to Link objects for user-entered URLs which don't
    supply scheme:  for example, fix up 'www.zope.com' to
    'http://www.zope.com'.  (tracker #361)

  - Updated CMFCore.CatalogTool to allow new, optional 'idxs'
    argument to 'catalog_object' (tracker #405).

  - Added a workaround for the problem where the CookieCrumber
    set cookies even though the user entered an incorrect password.
    RESPONSE.unauthorized() now cancels the cookie response
    header.  The new login_form and logged_in form both try to
    invoke unauthorized(), so make sure you install the new
    forms.

  - Implement the notional 'search results item' interface for
    SkinnedFolder.

  - Corrected solecism in Topic (use of 'criteria' for singular);
    removed the need to know about the funky generated IDs for
    criterion objects.  Fixed derived bug in skins (tracker #408).

  - Modified error-logging code to avoid potential leaks of
    traceback frame.

  - Made Document's 'manage_FTPget' use 'EditableBody', rather than
    accessing 'text' attribute directly (improves reusability).
    Likewise 'Document.SearchableText'.

  - Merged Seb Bacon's refactoring of 'getDefaultView' into
    'CMFCore.utils._getView'; clients can now specify a view by name,
    as well.

  - Made the default content type for Image 'image/png', instead
    of the unintuitive 'text/html' inherited from DefaultDublinCoreImpl
    (tracker #384).

  - Corrected typo in ActionsTool which broke actions for the root
    portal object (tracker #379).

  - Updated the MemberDataTool to use an OOBTree, instead of the
    old-style BTree, to store member data wrappers (CMF Tracker 375).

  - Corrected 'personalize_form' to use 'getProperty' where feasible,
    rather than relying on direct attribute access (tracker #372).

  - Removed an incompatibility with LoginManager in
    CMFCore.MembershipTool (tracker #365).

  - Removed an infinite loop condition that arises when
    MembershipTool.createMemberArea gets called inside wrapUser
    (this could only happen if "Create Member Area" was checked
    in the Membership tool.)

  - Added new 'TitleOrId' skin method, and updated skins to
    depend on it rather than SimpleItem.title_or_id.

  - Made unit tests runnable without reliance on 'zctl test'.

  - Corrected initial column set in catalog to include
    "ModificationDate" instead of "ModifiedDate".

  - Ensured that object is recatalogued (e.g., after setting
    'portal_type';  thanks to Florent Guillaume).

  - Removed silly dependency of 'CatalogTool.searchResults' on
    REQUEST (catalog already does the Right Thing (tm) when no
    REQUEST is available).  Note that this requires updates to
    the 'search' skins, as they didn't pass it in.

  - Changed redirect target after rejecting an item to the search
    page for pending content items;  this resolves the problem
    that the non-Manager reviewr who rejects an item no longer
    has View permission on it, and therefore gets an Unauthorized
    when redirecting to the object's view action.

  - Moved generation of the "Add to Favorites" and "My Favorites"
    links from the CMFCore/ActionsTool into the
    CMFDefault/MembershipTool, which is a more logical location
    for it because it relies on information from the membership tool.

  - Made Topic directly publishable (like PortalContent), using its
    'view' action (or the first action found, if view is not present).

  - Set title for newly-created member folders;  fixes
    breadcrumbs that expect a title on the object.

  - Allow URLs with query strings in StructuredText links.

  - Update 'news_box' to search based on 'Type', rather than
    'meta_type'.

  - Fix 'SkinnedFolder.Creator()' to call 'getOwner()' with
    info argument.

  - Made CookieCrumbler check for 'WEBDAV_SOURCE_PORT'
    environment variable (supplied by Zope 2.4.1+), and bail on
    intercepting authentication if found.

  - Included 'Owner' in list of significant roles returned by
    'MembershipTool.getPortalRoles' (e.g., so that the
   "Local Roles" interface can allow assignment of it).

  - Allow users with local role of "Reviewer" to see the "pending
    review" action.

  - Made TypesTool, rather than individual type objects,
    responsible for generating "immediate view" URL;  type
    objects now return the newly-created object, which makes
    scripting them much simpler.

  - Remove fossilized reference to 'getSecurityManager' from
    'PortalContent._verifyActionPermissions'.

  - Modified the redirect after "Add to Favorites" to us the
    view action, rather than 'view'.

  - Fixed 'Document.guessFormat()' to use
    'utils.html_headcheck()' instead of 'bodyfinder' regex to
    detect structured text versus html;  avoids recursion limit
    for large HTML files.

  - Removed spurious 'afterCreate' protocol for content objects.

  - Added mapping of 'css' file extension to FSDTMLMethods.

  - Modifed PortalFolder.listFolderContents to handle
    permission-based filtering; duplicates what skip_unauthorized
    is doing in DocumentTemplate/DT_IN.py (but works for ZPT as
    well).

  - Modified CMFDefault.RegistrationTool.addMember to avoid
    flunking validation if properties are not passed (Tracker
    #335).

  - Applied patch from Chris Withers to 'register' skin method;
    the patch which avoids quoting problems for the error message
    if a problem occurs (Tracker #339).

  - Added 'DiscussionItem.replyCount' (Tracker #328).
    'DiscussionItem.hasReplies' now returns only a boolean value.
    Standard skins don't call 'replyCount' due to performance
    concerns.

  - Factored content filtering logic into a Python Script.

  - Improved handling of multiple rename targets (thanks to Chris
    Withers for the patch.)

  - Completed conversion of form targets from DTML Methods to
    Python Scripts.

  - Improved compatibility with Zope 2.4:

    o support for new "restricted execution" mode;

    o support for new catalog initialization API.
  
    o updated 'test_all' unit test drivers to use standard
      'unittest' module from Python 2.1 (it no longer has
      'JUnitTestTextRunner' class).

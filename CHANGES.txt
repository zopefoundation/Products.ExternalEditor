  PluggableAuthService.py:

    - arrows images finally work in the ZMI
    - searchPrincipals will work for exact matches when a plugin
      supports both enumerateUsers and enumerateGroups
    - 'Authenticated' Role is added dynamically by the
      PluggableAuthService, not by any role manager

  plugins/ZODBGroupManager.py:

    - if a previously assigned principal goes away, the
      ZODBGroupManager won't freak out.

  plugins/ZODBRoleManager.py:

    - ZODBRoleManager will only claim authority for the
      __ac_roles__ of its grandparent that aren't 'Authenticated'
      or 'Anonymous'

    - if a previously assigned principal goes away, the
      ZODBRoleManager won't freak out.

  plugins/ZODBUserManager.py:

    - ZODBUserManager now uses AuthEncoding for its password
      encryption so that we can more easily support migrating
      existing UserFolders. Since PAS has been out for a while,
      though, we still will authenticate against old credentials

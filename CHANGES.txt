External Editor Change Log

    - Added the capability to borrow exising DAV locks. This allows external
      editor to play well with other systems using locks, such as CMFStaging. A
      new configuration flag, always_borrow_locks can be set to suppress the
      borrow lock warning dialog when editing.

      ViNiL.

      or wrap the editor in an xterm without using a shell script.
      
    - Rewrote "Editor did not launch" error message so it makes more sense.

      Jim Washington

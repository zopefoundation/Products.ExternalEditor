  Bug Fixes

    -

  Others

    - CMFDefault: Cleaned out some super-ancient code for migrating
      or fixing PTK content so it would work with CMF.

    - CatalogTool: Removed deprecated indexes and metadata.
      'Creator' was replaced by 'listCreators', 'portal_type' should be used
      instead of 'meta_type'.

    - CMFCore: Removed some deprecated aliases and constants.

    - Permissions: Removed deprecated oldstyle permission modules.

    - TypeInformation: Removed deprecated Type method.

    - PortalFolder: Removed deprecated _morphSpec() and spec arguments.

    - Portal Types: Removed deprecated _getViewFor / getActionById machinery.
      PortalContent objects might be used as methods, so __call__() still
      returns their default view.

    - CMFDefault and CMFTopic skins: Removed deprecated DTML skins and layers.

    - ActionsTool: Removed deprecated support for oldstyle Action Providers.
      If Action Providers don't implement the ActionProvider interface they
      are now ignored.

    - Workflow: Removed deprecated WorkflowMethod machinery.

CMF 1.5.1beta (unreleased)

  New Features

    - RegistrationTool: The regular expression that limits what people
      can put in as a valid member ID is now configurable TTW in the
      portal_registration tool (http://collector.zope.org/CMF/117)

  Bug Fixes

    - FSDTMLMethod: Small code cleanup to remove duplicate variable
      definition (http://collector.zope.org/CMF/291)

    - Document/NewsItem: If the "plain text" format is selected the
      content will no longer be tested for HTML and reduced to text
      between opening and closing "body" tags
      (http://collector.zope.org/CMF/214)

    - Document/NewsItem: A call to setFormat will now re-cook the
      document content if the format has been changed (arising from
      discussion about http://collector.zope.org/CMF/214)

    - DirectoryViews/FSMetadata: Corrected some erroneous docstrings
      about proxy role handling using .metadata files
      (http://collector.zope.org/CMF/177)

CMF 1.5.0beta2 (2004/09/27)

  Bug Fixes

    - FSFile: Allow setting a content_type value using a .metadata file
      (http://collector.zope.org/CMF/281)

    - FSPageTemplate: Refine the XML content type detection so that
      addtional data such as encoding is preserved
      (http://collector.zope.org/CMF/228)

    - ActionInformation: If a path expression ending in an object that
      gets called using __render_with_namespace__ (such as DTML objects
      and Scripts (Python)) is used a KeyError for "here" would be thrown
      inside PageTemplates.ZRPythonExpr.call_with_ns. call_with_ns
      expects the namespace to contain "here", which the context coming
      from CMFCore.Expressions.createExprContext did not provide. Added
      "here" as an alias pointing to the provided "object"
      (http://collector.zope.org/CMF/171)

    - CMFCatalogAware: When pasting a content item, local roles were not
      changed to reflect the new ownership.

Zelenium Product Changelog

  After Zelenium-0.6 (2005/05/09)

    - Upgrade to use the Selenium "core application" from Selenium 0.4.0.
      See http://selenium.thoughtworks.com/release-notes.html for a summary
      of changes.

      o **N.B.**:  the semantics of 'click' have changed;  that command
        no longer waits by default, and the 'nowait' modifier is no longer
        meaningful.  Use 'clickAndWait' to get the desired semantics.

  Zelenium-0.6 (2005/05/09)

    - CVS tag:  'Zelenium-0_6'

    - Add ability to suppress inclusion of Selenium support files in
      snapshot / download.

    - Add support for returning testcases from a mapped directory path,
      including recursion through subdirectories of that path.  Currently,
      the implementation has the following issues:

      o It only creates OFS.Image.File objects for test cases (no templates,
        scripts, etc.)

    - Add unit tests for Zuite.__getitem__ behavior, including support files.

  Zelenium-0.5.1 (2005/05/07)

    - CVS tag:  'Zelenium-0_5_1'

    - Make passing / failing test cases in results view more obvious in
      printed representation by adding icons.  N.B.: at the moment, we do
      this by sniffing the HTML of the test case for the "pink" backgrounds.

    - Apply patch from the selenium-devel list to fix regression in
      testcase HTML extraction in 'postTestResults'.

    - Make the posted results folder into its own class, derived from
      Folder (moving the template out to a PageTemplateFile).

    - Further repaired recursive ZIPfile generation, including normalizing
      URLs in generated HTML.

    - Extended zuite unittests to test 'listTestCases' and
      'manage_createSnapshot', as well as recursive ZIPfile generation.

  Zelenium-0.5 (2005/05/04)

    - CVS tag:  'Zelenium-0_5'

    - Updated to use the "TestRunner core" from Selenium version 0.3.0.
      See http://selenium.thoughtworks.com/release-notes.html for more
      information.

    - Add unit tests for Zuite class.

    - Make ZIPfile generation work with nested suites.

  Zelenium-0.4.1 (2005/05/02)

    - CVS tag:  'Zelenium-0_4_1'

    - Repair breakage of ExternalEditor link in 'manage_main'.

    - Compensate in display of test tables for non-padded integers
      in the IDs (make them sort properly).

  Zelenium-0.4 (2005/04/27)

    - CVS tag:  'Zelenium-0_4'
 
    - Make Zuite instances recursively include their Zuite children's
      test cases (to allow easier organization of the test cases in a
      hierarchy).

    - Allow indiviual zuites to override the list of metatypes which
      can be test cases, via a new 'testcase_metatypes' property.

    - Force Zuite objects to show order support, even in the presence of
      ExternalEditor, whose monkey patching seems to trip it up.  Surface
      the EE icon, if the product is available

      Note:  we are *forking* OFS/dtml/main.dtml and the version in
      ExteranalEditor/manage_main.dtml to surface order support, which
      is a pretty brutal hack.  We should probably get ExteranalEditor
      fixed, instead, and rip out the forked copy.

  Zelenium-0.3.1 (2005/04/26)

    - CVS tag:  'Zelenium-0_3_1'

    - Record server-side data during 'postResults':  Zope version string,
      product names and versions.

    - Captured additional request parameters in 'postResults':  user agent,
      HTTP host, remote address).

  Zelenium-0.3 (2005/04/25)

    - CVS tag:  'Zelenium-0_3'

    - Added 'postResults' handling code to capture results as a sub-
      folder of the suite.

  Zelenium-0.2.1 (2005/04/21)

    - CVS tag:  'Zelenium-0_2_1'

    - Correct the emitted HTML for input widgets (close the <tr> tag).

    - Fix unpack bug in code which punts on requests to "foreign" hosts.

    - Punt on handling XML-RPC requests (e.g., Epoz calls back to the
      server to run Tidy).

  Zelenium-0.2 (2005/04/20)

    - CVS tag:  'Zelenium-0_2'

    - Added script, 'generator.py', to create Selenium testcase files
      from the request / response logfiles created by tcpwatch.

    - Allowed test cases to be PageTemplates, as well as Files, to permit
      indirecting through properties of the test suite (e.g., for
      user id / password).

  Zelenium-0.1 (2005/04/15)

    - CVS tag:  'Zelenium-0_1'

    - Initial release

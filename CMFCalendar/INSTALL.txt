Installing CMFCalendar

  To install CMFCalendar, uncompress the CMFCalendar product into
  your zope/Products directory or link it there, e.g.::

    ln -s /path/to/installation /path/to/zope/Products

  In the root of your CMFSite installation (within the ZMI):

      1.  Add an external method to the root of the CMF Site.

      2.  Use the following configuration values for the external
          method:

          o id: install_events

          o title: Install Events *optional*

          o module name: CMFCalendar.Install

          o function name: install

      3. Go to the management screen for the newly added external
         method and click the 'Try it' tab.  

  The install function will execute and give information about the
  steps it took to register and install the CMF Events into the CMF
  Site instance.

  If you wish to use the zpt_calendar skins, you will need to
  have PageTemplates installed, and the CMFDecor product
  installed.

The CMFCalendar product is an example of creating a CMF Product.
The CMFCalendar product is also expected to be a generally useful out of the 'box' and skinnable to 
accomodate customization within your existing CMF instance.
To see how to go about building a CMF product, this hopefully allows a developer to follow 
through the process of registering their product, skins, and help with the CMF by example.
It shows how an object is created and registered with the types_tool, necessary skins added to the skins_tool, with the Calendar skins directory
 added to the skin paths, and providing portal_metadatool with an Element policy for the content_type of the object.

At the time of this writing, this product is incomplete.  The event is complete, and can stand alone, but will be 
accompanyied by the CMFCalendar in the next release.  We wished to get something out quickly, so we'll be living by the
 axiom: 'Release early; Release often' until all it's components are completed.

See the INSTALL.txt file for how to get the product installed within your CMF.

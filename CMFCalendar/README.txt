CMFCalendar README

  The CMFCalendar product is an example of creating a CMF
  Product.  The CMFCalendar product is also expected to be a
  generally useful out of the 'box' and skinnable to accomodate
  customization within your existing CMF instance.  To see how to
  go about building a CMF product, this hopefully allows a
  developer to follow through the process of registering their
  product, skins, and help with the CMF by example.  It shows how
  an object is created and registered with the types_tool,
  necessary skins added to the skins_tool, with the Calendar
  skins directory added to the skin paths, and providing
  portal_metadatool with an Element policy for the content_type
  of the object.

  The event portal_type is complete, and can be stand alone, but
  now accompanyied by the CMFCalendar which is fully functional
  and tested.

  After installing the CMFCalendar you should notice a calendar
  appear in your CMF.  This is fully customisable to your portals
  needs.

  See the INSTALL.txt file for how to get the product installed
  within your CMF.

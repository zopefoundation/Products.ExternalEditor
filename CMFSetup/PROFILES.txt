Profiles

  Overview

    There are two different kinds of profiles: Base profiles and extension
    profiles. Base profiles have no dependencies. Extension profiles are
    profile fragments used to modify base profiles. They can be shipped with
    add-on products or used for customization steps. Importing an extension
    profile adds or overwrites existing settings in a fine-grained way. You
    can't export extension profiles. Snapshots and exports always represent
    the merged settings.

  Update Directives

    For some XML elements there are additional attributes and values to
    specify update directives. They are only useful for extension profiles and
    you will never see them in snapshots and exports.

    'insert-before' and 'insert-after'

      applies to: object (generic); layer (skins.xml)

      'insert-before' and 'insert-after' specify the position of a new item
      relative to an existing item. If they are omitted or not valid, items
      are appended. You can also use '*' as wildcard. This will insert the new
      item at the top (before all existing items) or the bottom (after all
      existing items). If an item with the given ID exists already, it is
      moved to the specified position.

    'id="*"' wildcard

      applies to: skin-path (skins.xml)

      Updates all existing items in the container with the same settings.

    'remove'

      applies to: action-provider (actions.xml)

      Removes the specified item if it exists.

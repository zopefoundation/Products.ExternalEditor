Installing CMF 1.4x

  Requirements

    - Zope v. 2.5 and later
      
      o Note:  Zope v. 2.4.3 *may* work, but is no longer a supported
        version.

  Assumptions

    - New installation

    - Zope configured using INSTANCE_HOME, /var/zope, and
      SOFTWARE_HOME, /usr/local/zope/Zope-2.6.1

  Procedure

    1. Unpack the CMF-1.4x.tar.gz tarball into a working
       directory. For instance::

        $ cd /usr/local/zope
        $ tar xzf /tmp/CMF-1.4x.tar.gz

       Note for Windows users:  if you are using WinZip to unpack
          the file, be *sure* to disable the "TAR file smart CR/LF
          expansion" option (thanks to Frank McGeough for tracking
          down this problem!)


    2. Link (or copy/move) the CMF packages into
       $INSTANCE_HOME/Products (or into $SOFTWARE_HOME/lib/python/Products).
       For instance::

        $ cd /var/zope/Products  # /var/zope is INSTANCE_HOME
        $ ln -s /usr/local/zope/CMF-1.4x/CMFCore .
        $ ln -s /usr/local/zope/CMF-1.4x/CMFDefault .
        $ ln -s /usr/local/zope/CMF-1.4x/CMFTopic .
        $ ln -s /usr/local/zope/CMF-1.4x/CMFCalendar .
        $ ln -s /usr/local/zope/CMF-1.4x/DCWorkflow .
        
       or, as a shortcut::

        $ ln -s /usr/local/zope/CMF-1.4x/CMF* .
        $ ln -s /usr/local/zope/CMF-1.4x/DCWorkflow .

       Since linking doesn't apply on Windows, you will need
       to cut or copy the files from the place where you unpacked
       them to the 'Products' directory of your Zope.

    3. Restart Zope; verify that the CMF products loaded
       property, by examining them in Control_Panel/Product.

    4. Create a CMF Site object. join, and begin adding content.
       Enjoy!

Installing Internationalization (I18N) Support for CMF

  Requirements

    - Zope 2.6.0 or later

    - "Localizer":http://www.localizer.org

    - "TranslationService":http://www.zope.org/Members/efge/TranslationService

    - If you don't have the right language files (.po), you have to translate
      the messages yourself!

  Assumptions

    - CMF is installed as described above.

  Procedure

    1. From the ZMI of your CMFSite, select "Localizer" from the Add list. Use
       the default values.

    2. From the "Contents" tab of Localizer, select "MessageCatalog" from the
       Add list. Use 'CMFMessages' as id.

    3. Use the "Languages" tab of CMFMessages to select the languages you want
       to support.

    4. From the ZMI of your CMFSite, select "Translation Service" from the Add
       list. Use the default id.

    5. Use the "Configuration" tab of translation_service to set the
       MessageCatalog for the default domain to 'Localizer/CMFMessages'.

    6. Go again to the MessageCatalog 'CMFMessages'. If you have the right .po
       files, import them using the "Import/Export" tab.
       If you have no .po files, collect the message ids by using your site.
       Use the 'Messages' tab to translate the collected messages.

Upgrading from Earlier Versions

       you need / choose to revert).

    2. Unpack the tarball into a separate location; copy or
       link the subdirectories into the 'Products' directory of
       your INSTANCE_HOME.

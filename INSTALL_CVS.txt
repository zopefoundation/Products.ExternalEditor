Overview

 This document describes the process of getting the CMF from
 the CVS repository, and installing it into your Zope.  It assumes
 the following:

  * You want to install the "latest-and-greatest" version of
    the CMF from a CVS checkout.

    - See "Installing CMF":CMF-1.1/INSTALL.txt to install from a tarball.

    - See the note below [1] if you want to export or check out
      the sources for a specific version from CVS.

 *Please note that current versions of the CMF (1.1 and later)
  require Zope 2.3.2 or later*

  * For help with CVS in general, see the "CVS Online Manual",
    http://www.loria.fr/~molli/cvs-index.html

  * For direcitons on using the Zope CVS server, see "Public CVS
    Access", http://dev.zope.org/CVS/ReadOnlyAccess;
    substitute 'CMF' for 'Zope'.

Installation

  1. Fetch the CMF package from the Zope CVS repository::

     $ cd /tmp
     $ cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.zope.org:/cvs-repository login
       <supply "anonymous" as the password>
     $ cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.zope.org:/cvs-repository \
       checkout -d CMF-head CMF

     This checkout creats a directory, 'CMF-head', which contain
     subdirectories:

      - CMFCore

      - CMFDefault

      - CMFTopic

      - CMFCalendar

     and several others.

  2. Copy or link each of these subdirectories into the 'Products' directory of
     your Zope server (either SOFTWARE_HOME or INSTANCE_HOME) e.g.::

      $ cd /var/zope/Products
      $ mv /tmp/CMF-head/CMFDefault .
      $ mv /tmp/CMF-head/CMFDefault .
      $ mv /tmp/CMF-head/CMFTopic .

  3. Verify filesystem products:

     Start or restart your Zope server.  Check to see that the
     following products are present in the Control_Panel / Products
     list;  each should show a "normal" (non-broken) icon, and
     should have a version number matching the release version of
     the snapshot:

      - CMFCore

      - CMFDefault

      - CMFTopic

  4. Create a CMF Site:

     From the management interface, somewhere in the "main"
     section of your site (*not* the Control_Panel!),
     select "Portal (New)" from the add list.  Fill out the
     constructor form, and click the "Add" button.

Refreshing your Checkout

  Note that to refresh an existing CVS sandbox, you should
  use 'cvs up -d -P' (assuming you want to remove obsolete
  directories and retrieve any newly-added ones).

Fetching a Previous Version

.. [1]  A normal CVS checkout retrieves what is called the "head"
  (the latest revision for each file) from the "main trunk"
  (no unmerged branches).

 Retrieving Sources for a Release

   Sources for prior releases are tagged, using the release
   version identifier, but with the periods replaced with
   underscores.  For instance, version 1.1 of the CMF
   was tagged as 'CMF-1_1-src'.  To fetch such a
   release from CVS::

    $ cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.zope.org:/cvs-repository \
      checkout -r CMF-1_1-src CMF
